# "StackyPi Style"

This repository documents lessons learned about the [StackyPi RP2040 board from SB Components](https://shop.sb-components.co.uk/products/stackypi?_pos=1&_sid=7ecd982d7&_ss=r).

It also contains example code for driving various components of the board.

A goal would be to build a MicroPython definition that makes the board easy to use, as well as to collect information about usable add-ons.
